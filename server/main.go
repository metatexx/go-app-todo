	// or the server that serves the app.

	// When executed on the client-side, the RunWhenOnBrowser() function
	// launches the app,  starting a loop that listens for app events and
	// executes client instructions. Since it is a blocking call, the code below
	// it will never be executed.
	//
	// When executed on the server-side, RunWhenOnBrowser() does nothing, which
	// lets room for server implementation without the need for precompiling
	// instructions.

	// Finally, launching the server that serves the app is done by using the Go
	// standard HTTP package.
